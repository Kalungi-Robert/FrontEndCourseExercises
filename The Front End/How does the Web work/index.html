        <p>
          The Internet is a vast, sprawling collection of networks that connect
          to each other. In fact, the word "Internet" could be said to come from
          this concept: interconnected networks,There are two main concepts that
          are fundamental to the way the Internet functions: packets and
          protocols.

        <h2>INTERNET PROTOCOLS</h2>
        <p>
          In networking, a protocol is a standardized way of doing certain
          actions and formatting data so that two or more devices are able to
          communicate with and understand each other. Connecting two computers,
          both of which may use different hardware and run different software,
          is one of the main challenges that the creators of the Internet had to
          solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          It requires the use of communications techniques that are
          understandable by all connected computers, just as two people who grew
          up in different parts of the world may need to speak a common language
          to understand each other
        </p>
        <p>
          This problem is solved with standardized protocols in networking, a
          protocol is a standardized way of doing certain actions and formatting
          data so that two or more devices are able to communicate with and
          understand each other. Whereas their are protocols used for sending
          packets between devices on the same network (Ethernet)

    <!-- THE PACKETS -->
    <section id="Internet-packets" class="section_style">
      <div class="info_style">
        <h2>INTERNET PACKETS</h2>
        <p>
          In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Each
          packet contains both data and information about that data. The
          information about the packet's contents is known as the "header," and
          it goes at the front of the packet so that the receiving machine knows
          what to do with the packet. When data gets sent over the Internet, it
          is first broken up into smaller packets, which are then translated
          into bits. <p>The packets get routed to their destination by various
          networking devices such as routers and switches. When the packets
          arrive at their destination, the receiving device reassembles the
          packets in order and can then use or display the data. Packets are
          sent across the Internet using a technique called packet switching.
          Intermediary routers and switches are able to process packets
          independently from each other, without accounting for their source or
          destination.</p>
          <p>This is by design so that no single connection dominates
          the network. If data was sent between computers all at once with no
          packet switching, a connection between two computers could occupy
          multiple cables, routers, and switches for minutes at a time.
          Essentially, only two people would be able to use the Internet at a
          time â€” instead of an almost unlimited number of people, as is the case
          in reality</p>

        <p>
          IP address stands for internet protocol address; it is an identifying
          number that is associated with a specific computer or computer
          network. When connected to the internet, the IP address allows the
          computers to send and receive information. for sending packets from
          networks to networks.

          Tcp/Internet Protocol (TCP / IP) , is a collection of communication
          protocols to which it based Internet and a large percentage of
          commercial networks. The name TCP / IP from the abbreviations of two
